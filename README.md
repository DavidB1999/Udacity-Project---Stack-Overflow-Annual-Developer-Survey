# Developer Salary Prediction 

## What this is all about.
This project is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/nd025) i am working on. The Blog post can be found [here](tbd). <br>
Part of the challenge was to find an interesting but managable data set within the listed options. I decided to take a closer look at the [Annual Developer Survey from Stack Overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/) from 2024. <br>

The idea was to model the salary for different tpyes of developers and indentify the factors that influence salary in these tech roles.


## Setup
For this project I was using Python version `3.11.1`.<br>
All required packages can be found in `requirements.txt`. <br>
The main content of this project is in the Jupyer Notebook `Analysis.ipynb`. The data used was downloaded from [Stack Overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/).
